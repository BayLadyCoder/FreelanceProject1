              <h2>Medicare Supplement Plans</h2>
              <h3 class="text-capitalize">medicare supplement insurance (Medi-Gap)</h3>
              <p>Medi-Gap is supplemental insurance to cover some of the “gaps” that Original Medicare (Medicare Parts A and B) does not cover. Medicare out-of-pocket costs can include deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.
              Medi-Gap policies are standardized by the federal government, and sold by private insurance companies. The benefits offered in every Medi-Gap policy are standardized by the Federal Government, and can be easily compared between carriers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="showcase-one">
              <h3 class="text-capitalize">eligibility</h3>
              <p>To be eligible for a Medi-Gap plan, you must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B (Original Medicare) and either be 65 years of age or older. The best time to enroll in a Medi-Gap Medicare insurance policy is during your open enrollment period. Your open enrollment period lasts for six months, and begins on the first day of the month in which you are both age 65 years of age or older, and enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B. During this time, insurance companies are not allowed to deny you a policy or increase your premiums because of pre-existing conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="showcase-one">
              <h3 class="text-capitalize">Under 65?</h3>
              <p>Depending on the state you reside in, you may be eligible for Medi-Gap policies if you are under the age of 65. Some states require Medi-Gap insurance providers to sell insurance policies to individual's recieving Social Security Disability benefits for 24 months, or individuals that have been diagnosed with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), as these individuals are eligible for Original Medicare. Federal law does not require Medicare Insurance companies to sell policies to those individuals under the age of 65, although some states require that Medicare Insurance providers must offer at least one Medi-Gap plan to those individuals under the age of 65, who are eligible for Original Medicare.</p>

              <h2>Medicare Supplement Plans Options</h2>
              <h3 class="text-capitalize">medi-gap-plans</h3>
              <p>There are 10 Medi-gap plans to choose from in most states (Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have different Medi-gap plan options). The Federal Government standardizes the plan options available in most states.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 10 Medi-gap plans are Plan A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M and N. Insurance companies must offer the same benefits for each lettered plan option. For example, Plan C will always have the same benefits no matter which company you buy it from. The only difference between one insurance company and another is price. Below are the various Medi-Gap policies and their benefits:

                  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">What is Medicare?</h3>
                  <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides affordable health care options for seniors 65 and older, disabled citizens, and those suffering from ESRD. There are four parts: Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. Medicare Part A and Part B (also known as Original Medicare) provide hospital and medical insurance. Medicare Part C is known as Medicare Advantage. Medicare Part D provides prescription drug coverage.</p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">What is Medicare Supplement Insurance?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Medicare Supplement insurance (Medi-Gap) is a private form of medical insurance, which covers some Medicare out-of-pocket costs. A policy can help pay for Medicare deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance, and other costs.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">Am I eligible for Medicare Supplement Insurance?</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you are enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B (Original Medicare), and are 65 and older or have a qualifying disability, you are eligible for Medi-Gap. You are also eligible if you are enrolled in Medicare Part A, are 65 or older, and are currently enrolling in Medicare Part B.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">What are the differences between Medi-Gap plans?</h3>
                  <p>
                    There are 10 different Medi-Gap plans currently available for purchase in most states: Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N. Each plan offers a different array of benefits. Insurance companies must offer the same benefits for each plan option. For example, one insurer’s Plan G will have the same benefits as another insurer’s Plan G. The only difference between the two companies’ policies is price.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">Can an insurance company refuse to sell me a Medi-Gap Plan?</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you enroll during the open enrollment period, an insurance company cannot deny you coverage. If you miss your open enrollment period, an insurance company is legally allowed to deny your application. The insurance company will determine your eligibility outside of the open enrollment period, by your current and past medical history. If you have had significant medical issues in the past 10 years, the insurance company will consider this and might not approve your application. Chances are, if you have been healthy for the past 10 years, with no significant medical conditions, you will be approved. The insurance company might place a waiting period on individuals with a pre-existing condition.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">What is the “Waiting Period”?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Medi-Gap waiting period is only applicable to those who sign up for a Medi-Gap plan outside of the open enrollment period. If you enroll after your OEP, the insurance company may enforce a waiting period that lasts up to 6 months. During this time, the insurance company can refuse to cover the out-of-pocket treatment costs related to any pre-existing conditions.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">Does Medi-Gap cover Prescription Drugs?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Medi-Gap policies do not provide prescription drug coverage. Medi-Gap plans stopped providing prescription drug coverage in 2006. If you are enrolled in a Medi-Gap policy, you can get prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">Will my premium change?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The pricing structure used on your Medi-Gap policy will influence impact how your premium increases in the future. There are 3 types of pricing structures: attained-age pricing, community-rated pricing, and issue-age pricing. If your policy is attained-age, the premium will increase as you age. If your policy is issue-age, the premium will not increase as you age but can increase based on other factors. If your policy is community-rated, the premium can increase based on inflation.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="text-capitalize">What happened to Medi-Gap Plans E, H, I, J, and K?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Medi-Gap plans E, H, I, and J are no longer available for purchase. In 2010, the federal government added new plans and removed older plans including plans E, H, I, J, and K. If you have plan E, H, I, J, or k, you are still allowed to use your policy.
