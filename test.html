              <h2>Life Insurance</h2>
              <h3 class="text-capitalize">Welcome to the life insurance area of our Web Site. This section covers the basics of life insurance. </h3>
              <p>Today, there is a wide variety of life insurance available, the most basic of which are term and permanent. Within each of these categories, however, there are many different types to choose from – and being familiar with these can help you better customize the coverage to meet your specific needs.</p>

              <h3 class="text-capitalize">10 Different Types of Life Insurance Policies on the Market Today</h3>

              <div class="tenTypesContainer">
                <p class="tenTypes"><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Term</p>
                <div class="tenTypesTextBox">
                  <h4>Term Life Insurance Policies</h4>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    Term life insurance is considered to be the most basic of life insurance that can be purchased. This is because term life offers just pure death benefit protection only, without any cash value builds up within the policy. Because of this, term life insurance is often very affordable – especially for those applicants who are younger and in good health at the time they apply for the coverage. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    With term life insurance, coverage is purchased for a certain length of time, such as for ten years, 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, and 30 years – and in some cases, even longer. There is also a 1-year renewable term life insurance option that is offered by many of the best life insurance carriers.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    Typically, when purchasing a level term life insurance policy, the amount of the premium will remain the same throughout the period that the policy is in force. Provided that the insured survives throughout the time period of the policy, and he or she wishes to remain covered by life insurance, they will need to re-qualify for a new policy at their then-current age and health status. At that time, the premium on a new life insurance policy may be quite a bit higher. In some cases, a term life insurance policy may have an option to convert the coverage over into a permanent life insurance plan.

                  <div class="tenTypesTextBox">
                   <h4>Increasing and Decreasing Term Life Insurance Coverage</h4>
                   <p class="tenTypesText">
                    On some types of term life insurance, the death benefit will go down over time. These are known as decreasing term life insurance policies. (The premium, however, will usually remain the same). With a decreasing term policy, the policy ends when the death benefit reaches zero.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    An individual may want to purchase a decreasing term life insurance policy to cover the balance of their unpaid mortgage. Each year, as the amount of the mortgage balance decreases, so does the amount of the insurance coverage – until eventually both will end.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    There are also term policies where the death benefit increases over time. Often, this benefit will be purchased as a cost of living rider on the policy. A young parent may consider this type of policy as their coverage needs increase.

                  <h4>Permanent Life Insurance Coverage</h4>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    Permanent Life Insurance is different from term insurance, because it offers both death benefit protection, as well as a cash value component. It also differs because as the name suggests, it does not have a time limit like term insurance, but rather is intended to last for the remainder of the insured’s lifetime – provided that the premium is paid. There are many different types of permanent life insurance.

                 <div class="tenTypesTextBox">
                  <h4>Whole Life Insurance Coverage</h4>
                   <p class="tenTypesText">
                     The simplest type of permanent life insurance coverage is Whole Life. With this type of coverage, the premium amount is locked in, and will remain the same throughout the entire lifetime of the policy. This can be helpful for those who need to stick to a budget. It also means that if a person purchases a whole life policy at a very young age, they will still pay the same amount of premium when they get older – regardless of advancing age, or even an adverse health issue.
                   </p>
                   <p class="tenTypesText">
                    In some cases, where a person’s pre-existing conditions require the individual to buy high risk life insurance, some graded whole life policies are the only option.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    The cash that is in the cash value (see below for cash value explanation) component of a whole life insurance policy is allowed to grow on a tax-deferred basis. This means that the gain on these funds will not be taxed until or unless they are withdrawn – allowing them to compound exponentially over time.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    At first, the cash in a whole life insurance policy will grow slowly. This is because the majority of the early premium dollars will go towards paying the agent’s commission and the insurance costs. However, over the years, the cash in a whole life policy can steadily grow, often with a minimum guaranteed rate of return.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tenTypesText">
                    Some whole life insurance policies will even provide dividends to their policyholders. Because these are considered to be a return of premium to the policyholder, they are also not taxed. Dividends can also help the cash value in a policy grow significantly – although they are never guaranteed.
